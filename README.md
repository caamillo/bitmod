# BitMod

## What is this?
basically I use to rent scooters and I needed a way to rent them for life (endless parking spot glitch).

## Features

- ElysiaJS HTTPServer (Bun based) that handles APIs between User <-> Bit
- Endless Book Glitch
- Redis cache-db that stores booking infos + Cron that every minute checks if a device needs to be re-booked

## How can I launch it?
U just have to add in ur `.env`:

```
URL=<bit_url>
UUID1=<uuid1>
UUID2=<uuid2>
```

I dont even know what uuid1 and uuid2 is used for but I found mine through the login request.

Then, do `bun install` (you have to install [Bun](https://bun.sh)).
And finally `bun start` to start the HTTPServer.
Also u want to start the cron so open another CLI and type `bun run cron.js`.

Enjoy ur ride sir ðŸ˜½ðŸ˜½
